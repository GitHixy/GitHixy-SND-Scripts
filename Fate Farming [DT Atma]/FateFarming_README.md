## Installation and Usage

### Required Plugins
- **Something Need Doing [Expanded Edition]**: Main plugin
- **VNavmesh**: For pathfinding and movement
- **Rotation plugin** (one of):
  - RotationSolver Reborn
  - BossMod Reborn  
  - Veyn's BossMod

### Instructions
1. Import the script into SND (Something Need Doing)
2. Configure parameters according to your preferences
3. If you want to use Demiatma farming, enable "Enable Atma Farming" and set "Target Atma per Zone"
4. Start the script - it will automatically teleport to the appropriate zone
5. The script will automatically handle everything: FATE farming, zone switching, purchases, resurrections

## How Atma Integration Works

1. **Initial check**: Script checks your inventory to determine which Demiatma you already have
2. **Zone selection**: Teleports to the first zone where you haven't reached the target Demiatma count
3. **Farming**: Performs FATEs in the current zone
4. **Progress monitoring**: After each FATE checks if you've obtained new Demiatma
5. **Automatic zone switching**: When you reach the target for current zone, automatically moves to the next
6. **Completion**: When all zones are completed, continues normal FATE farming

## Development Notes

This script represents a significant evolution of pot0to's original version. The main modifications include:

- Complete rewrite of the Atma management system
- Native integration with Dawntrail zones
- New helper functions for tracking and progression
- Improvements to status visualization
- Optimizations for SND v2 APIs

The code maintains compatibility with all original features while adding a completely new layer for automatic Dawntrail Demiatma management.
